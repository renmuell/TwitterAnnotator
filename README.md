# TwitterAnnotator

Twitter Annotator is an UI-Prototype for annotation tweets. Currently it has a dummy back-end to showcase the concept.

While helping a friend to annotate tweets for his research paper, i created this little prototype. It was partly a design challenge and i wanted to show some possible improvements for this ui. 

Goal was simplicity and elegance.

## Features

- browser history support
- tweet syntax highlight
- pause the annotation
- keyboard support:

  Q - previous
  E - next
  A - irrelevant
  S - neutral
  D - opinionated
  Space â€“ pause/resume
  W - help
