# TwitterAnnotator

This is a little prototype i designed and programmed for a friend. You can annotate a tweet with one of three labels. Goal was simplicity and elegance.

- browser history support
- tweet syntax highlight
- pause annotation
- as much vanilla JavaScript as possible
- keyboard support:

	Q - previous
	
	E - next
	
	A - irrelevant
	
	S - neutral
	
	D - opinionated
	
	Space â€“ pause/resume
