# TwitterAnnotator

Twitter Annotator is an UI-Prototype for annotating tweets. Currently, it has a dummy back-end to showcase the concept.

While helping a friend to annotate tweets for his research paper, I created this little prototype. It was partly a design challenge and I wanted to show some possible improvements for his UI. 

The goal was simplicity and elegance.

## Features

- responsive design
- browser history support
- tweet syntax highlight
- keyboard support:

  | Key | Action          |
  |---- | --------------- |
  |  Q  | previous Tweet  |
  |  E  | next Tweet      |
  |  A  | set Irrelevant  |
  |  S  | set Neutral     |
  |  D  | set Opinionated |
  |  C  | pause/resume    |
  |  W  | toggle Help     |
